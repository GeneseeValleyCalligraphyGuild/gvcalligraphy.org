## Welcome to the Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild

![Artist: Annie Barnhardt](/img/annieb_forever.jpg)

The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild is a learning guild with members at all levels of experience. By sharing a love of traditional and contemporary handwritten letters, we build friendships and a greater confidence in our art.

The guild was founded in April, 1983 in Rochester, NY. We practice beautiful hand lettering; some of our members have been with us from our founding, others are very new to calligraphy. We all love letters and lettering.

**We meet in the Perinton Recreation Center, 1350 Turk Hill Road, Fairport. Meetings are available on Zoom for members. Some of our meetings will hybrid, and some will be on Zoom. See the Meetings page for a tentative schedule.**

We meet on the First Wednesday of each month at 7:00 PM,. We welcome prospective new members to attend a meeting before joining. The programs are varied and cover topics of interest to the lettering artist.

Have you always wondered about calligraphy and didn’t know who to ask? Are you looking to take up a new hobby that is relaxing and meaningful? Do you want to get away from computer generated mailings and send a hand lettered envelope to a relative or friend? Guild members will be on hand to answer questions and share resources with you.

**Speedball Textbook**

The “Centennial Edition” of the Speedball Textbook features an expanded history section showcasing additional pages from older editions as well as all new artwork!

In conjunction with the book, they have a website (http://www.speedballart.com) which has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) about their products, and some downloads under the Media tab for screen printing, lettering, drawing.

The Speedball Textbook book has always been a reflection of the lettering of its time. This special Centennial Edition is a record of lettering today and an invaluable resource for students of all ages and levels.
