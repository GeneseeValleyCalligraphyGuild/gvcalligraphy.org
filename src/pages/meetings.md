**2020 Programs**

As part of our mission to learn and teach calligraphy, we are going to concentrate on specific letter forms for several months to a year. After learning the basics, we will use the letters in small, fun projects and then study variations on the letters.

We are beginning our study this year with Roman (capital) letters, based on the Trajan column in Rome. Romans are the “parent” of all modern letters (the I and O dictate the formation of every other letter in a style). 

**Our Schedule for the first half of the year follows (subject to change):**

**January 8** - brief introduction; elements of design with Rei.

**February 5 and March 4 –** monoline (pencil) Roman letters, with a simple color project near the end of the meeting, led by Georgie

**April 1 –** CANCELED

**May 6 –** CANCELED

**June 3 –** Zoom meeting

**July 1 –** Zoom meeting

**August 5 **- combination Zoom and in-person, sharing of From My Heart project pieces. Following the program, there will be a special announcement of our programs for the next six months from Toi and Lisa.  Exciting things are happening!

We also have several Play Days scheduled on Saturdays (January 18, July 25) where we can explore other tools and variations.
