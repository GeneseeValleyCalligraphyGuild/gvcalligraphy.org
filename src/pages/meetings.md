## Tentative 2025 Programs

**On April 2, after a short business meeting we will review the Mike Gold workshop many guild members took earlier this year. We will also have a Free Trash and Treasures Table - bring tools, magazines, books, papers, etc. you want to give away. Anything that doesn't find a new home must be retrieved by the owner.**

**Second Saturdays** will continue in the Perinton Recreation Center\
Watch for more dates coming up. We will bring pieces we're working on, and have tools, techniques and paper for anyone who wishes to stop in and try.
