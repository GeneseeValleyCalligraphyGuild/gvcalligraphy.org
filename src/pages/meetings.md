**2020 Programs**

As part of our mission to learn and teach calligraphy, we are going to concentrate on specific letter forms for several months to a year. After learning the basics, we will use the letters in small, fun projects and then study variations on the letters.

We are beginning our study this year with Roman (capital) letters, based on the Trajan column in Rome. Romans are the “parent” of all modern letters (the I and O dictate the formation of every other letter in a style). 

We are also hosting Australian calligrapher Gemma Black in August; she is on her final international teaching tour. We have chosen a beautiful watercolor cutback technique that she teaches with Roman letterforms. More information will be available soon.

**Our Schedule for the first half of the year follows (subject to change):**

**January 8** - brief introduction; elements of design with Rei.\
Please look through some magazines, Christmas Cards, brochures etc. See what you think is a good design and what "needs work". Bring scissors, paper and or a quote you like. We will work on the elements of design and work on finishing a small project. Bring your favorite writing tools and an OPEN mind. You may want to try your hand at ROMANS,

**February 5 and March 4 –** monoline (pencil) Roman letters, with a simple color project near the end of the meeting, led by Georgie

**April 1 –** pressure-and-release monoline Roman letters in graphite and colored pencil, led by Lisa

**May 6 –** broad-edge pen letters, with “dip” pens and ink or paint – we will also cover “seasoning” and loading a nib for those new to dip pens – presenter TBA

We also plan to host a 1-day workshop with Annie Barnhardt in late May on built-up colored pencil Roman letters on dark paper

**June 3 –** large letters, using whole arm movements, and then cutting those letters to use in a projects, led by Carolyn

**July 1 –** Design OR a field trip to the RIT Cary library, which has a diorama and tracing of the letters of the Trajan column, as well as work by contemporary calligraphers who spent time at RIT.

We also have several Play Days scheduled on Saturdays (January 18, April 18 or 25, July 25) before the workshop where we can explore other tools and variations.

**2019 Programs**

January - Planning Meeting

February - [Calligraphy and Snowflakes](../february-meeting) 

March - [Alphabet "Soup"](../march-meeting)

April - [Visiting WWII Vet and artist Owen Hughes](../april-meeting)

May -We viewed slides from our collection of work done by instructors at past conferences. We discussed what made some of those pieces work effectively.

June - What’s keeping you from making art? \
Georgie systematically addressed the barriers to our creativity. For inspiration, she provided a handout of quotations about tea\
plus an assortment of cup and mug images and encouraged us to adapt them to our work. \
She and Lisa provided us with a supply of Arches Textwove paper. 

July - Drawn Letters\
Ellen shared several handouts featuring an assortment of drawn letters. Drawn letters are constructed with a smaller instrument rather than written with a standard calligraphy nib. \
To easily draw calligraphic strokes, two pencils can be held together with a rubber band or tape. Two leads can fit comfortably in a piece of plastic straw. These strokes will form the skeleton of the letter. You will use a monoline tool, such as a single pencil, to fill out the rest of the shape. \
Drawn letters lend themselves to an assortment of coloring techniques. We experimented with tools, and shared ideas among ourselves. 

August - Program: Karen Barber and Rei Pizzaro told us about their experiences at the summer conference.

September - Blackletter\
After a discussion about guild revitalization, Marian gave us a quick overview of Blackletter, with handouts and practice paper. We explored the two broad groups - the N family and the O family. Miniscules only; majuscules are an entirely different kettle of fish!

October - Sharing and planning\
After the initial planning portion of the meeting, those who participated in the guild’s recent lunchtime program at the recreation center shared what they did with the rest of us. 

November\
First: those who were at the workshop with Barbara Close brought something of their work to share. Several wonderful accordion books were shown.\
Second: Marian  demonstrated a new projector system that will allow easier demonstrations at meetings.\
Third: Rei presented a program on Christmas cards. We spent time making cards and sharing our work.

December\
We gathered for an evening of refreshments and socializing with a little bit of calligraphic fun thrown into the celebratory mix. We also analyzed commercial holiday or greeting cards.  Finally we had a Yankee Gift Swap.
