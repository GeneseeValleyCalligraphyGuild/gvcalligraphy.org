**2020 Programs**

As part of our mission to learn and teach calligraphy, we are going to concentrate on specific letter forms for several months to a year. After learning the basics, we will use the letters in small, fun projects and then study variations on the letters.

We began our study this year with Roman (capital) letters, based on the Trajan column in Rome. Romans are the “parent” of all modern letters (the I and O dictate the formation of every other letter in a style). 

After the first 3 meetings, followed by a break, we had online Zoom meetings for 2 months. Beginning in August, our meetings include both Zoom and in-person involvement.

**August 5** - combination Zoom and in-person, sharing of From My Heart project pieces, plus announcements about plans for the next 6 months.

The next six months will involve making and playing with lettering in Stash Fan Books.

**October 7 ** - using color in calligraphy.\
October’s focus will be color so have some color pencils, watercolor, etc. ready for use. Pencil, eraser, nice paper for dry and wet mediums. You may want to apply color to the letters you started last month.  Or start with new letters this month.\
\*\**6:45 pm, orientation to new meeting structure,  7:00 October’s guild meeting
