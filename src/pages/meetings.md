**2019 Programs**

January - Planning Meeting

February - [Calligraphy and Snowflakes](../february-meeting) 

March - [Alphabet "Soup"](../march-meeting)

April - [Visiting WWII Vet and artist Owen Hughes](../april-meeting)

May -We viewed slides from our collection of work done by instructors at past conferences. We discussed what made some of those pieces work effectively.\
A few of the things we noted were:

1. Calligraphy doesn’t need to be on paper. One stunning piece was carved from wood.
2. Colors can be used in an variety of ways. Backgrounds, decorative elements, and the lettering itself offer opportunities to add color.
3. Visual texture is created by the density of strokes, as is a sense of motion.
4. Some calligraphy is not intended to be read, using calligraphic strokes as painterly elements.

June - What’s keeping you from making art? \
Georgie systematically addressed the barriers to our creativity. For inspiration, she provided a handout of quotations about tea\
plus an assortment of cup and mug images and encouraged us to adapt them to our work. \
She and Lisa provided us with a supply of Arches Textwove paper. This is a preferred paper for many artists because it’s slightly translucent, making tracing easy. It also takes wet media well and dries flat. It’s ideal for paste paper and bookbinding. 

July - Drawn Letters\
Ellen shared several informative handouts featuring an assortment of drawn letters. Drawn letters are constructed with a smaller instrument rather than written freely with a standard calligraphy nib. \
To easily draw calligraphic strokes, two pencils can be held together with a rubber band or tape. Two leads can fit comfortably in a piece of plastic straw. These strokes will form the skeleton of the letter. You will use a monoline tool, such as a single pencil, to fill out the rest of the shape. \
Drawn letters lend themselves to an assortment of coloring techniques. We experimented with our own tools, and shared ideas among ourselves. \
Ellen provided a generous supply of papers for our lettering pleasure. Corners of envelopes make wonderful decorated bookmarks. Long strips are a classic choice. 

ALSO: several artists brought their coffee and tea pieces. Each artist received a slip to add their names to a drawing for one of three Alice in Wonderland / tea themed prizes. Bring either a finished piece or the beginnings of a second one to the August meeting for another chance!

August - Program: Karen Barber and Rei Pizzaro told us about their experiences at the summer conference.

September - Blackletter\
After a discussion about guild revitalization, Marian gave us a quick overview of Blackletter, with handouts and practice paper. We explored the two broad groups - the N family and the O family. Miniscules only; majuscules are an entirely different kettle of fish!

October - Sharing and planning\
After the initial planning portion of the meeting, those who participated in the guild’s recent lunchtime program at the recreation center shared what they did with the rest of us. 

November\
First: Georgie asked those who were at the workshop with Barbara Close bring something of their work to share. Several wonderful accordion books were shown.\
Second: Marian  demonstrated a new projector system that will allow easier demonstrations at meetings.\
Third: Rei presented a program on Christmas cards. We spent time making cards and sharing our work.

December\
Come to the December guild meeting for the party of the year!\
Back by popular vote on Wednesday, December 4, 2019 is an evening of refreshments and socializing with a little bit of calligraphic fun thrown into the celebratory mix.\
1.   Refreshments.  Bring a small offering if you are so inclined. May include chocolate but probably not wine.  Please be sure to wear your name tag.\
2.   The second activity of the evening involves a fun analysis of commercial holiday or greeting cards.  To take part in this, please bring a card, the design of which you think either “works” or “doesn’t work”.  Lisa commented on this characteristic when she presented the calligraphy slide show in June.  It is a subjective attribute; a card that appeals to one person may not hit the spot for someone else.  Lisa will have a supply of extra commercial card fronts if someone forgets theirs.\
3.   Third. a Yankee Gift Swap.  To participate, bring in something related to calligraphy that is either pre-owned in good condition, or brand-new. (If purchasing, please spend no more than 10 dollars.) Make sure your item is wrapped.  We will have a repeat of David’s Yankee swap for all those who bring something in.  In other words, bring one, get one.
