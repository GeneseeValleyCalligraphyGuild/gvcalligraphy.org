**2023 Programs**

**This year is our 40th Anniversary and we are planning many activities to celebrate.**

**September 6**\
We will have a special guest presenter, Nancy Hays Hills (over zoom).\
For those who wish to be together, we'll meet at the Perinton Rec. Center Rm 204 and have a screen to view Nancy's presentation. \
The meeting will start at 7- and after an introduction, Nancy will show her journals and share stories for about an hour, with Q & A following. *This means it might go til almost 9pm. 

Field trips to the RIT Cary Collection in October and other locations are just a few of our activities. Stay in touch!
