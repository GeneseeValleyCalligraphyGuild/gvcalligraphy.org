As part of our mission to learn and teach calligraphy, we are going to concentrate on specific letter forms for several months to a year. After learning the basics, we will use the letters in small, fun projects and then study variations on the letters.

January - the monthly meeting was replaced with a Play Day on January 23..

February - Big and small letters

March - Turning work while designing, reviewing swatch books.\
  Draw at least four 1.5 inch squares on a piece of paper; \
   have pencil, monoline marker, broad edge marker (no bigger than 3.5 mm), ruler, \
     and optional colored pencils ready to use.
