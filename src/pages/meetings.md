**2023 Programs**

**This year is our 40th Anniversary and we are planning many activities to celebrate.**

**December 6**\
We're having an in-person party at the Perinton Recreation Center, to celebrate our anniversary year.

Plans for next year are being finalized; a tentative schedule will be forthcoming.

Second Saturdays: watch for more dates coming up. We will bring pieces we're working on, and have tools, techniques and paper for anyone who wishes to stop in and try.
