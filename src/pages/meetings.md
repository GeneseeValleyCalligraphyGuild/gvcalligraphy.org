**Beginning March 1, 2023 we will be meeting in the Community Room at the Barnes and Noble store in Pittsford Plaza. We plan to make these meetings hybrid to enable those who cannot be there in person to participate.**

We meet on the First Wednesday of each month at 7:00 PM,. We welcome prospective new members to attend a meeting before joining. The programs are varied and cover topics of interest to the lettering artist.

On January 14, we will have Play Day from 11 AM - 1 PM at the Perinton Community Center at 1350 Turk Hill Road.
