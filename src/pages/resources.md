R.I.T.

You do not need to be a registered student at R.I.T. to take a calligraphy class. Each quarter a different hand is taught: fall is Italic, winter is Roman caps, and spring is Foundational/Uncial. Tuition is reduced for non-credit courses. Guild member Lorrie Frear teaches the classes. Contact R.I.T.



The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild does not endorse any particular resource. We provide this list as a reference tool only.
