**An Exhibit  of our work will be on display at the Pittsford Barnes & Noble from August 3 until August 30. About 100 pieces of calligraphic art will be on display.**

We're working on traveling exhibits that will be displayed at local libraries and businesses.

Below are some pictures of the exhibit at the Macedon and Penfield Libraries in 2018.
