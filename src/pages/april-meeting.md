The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild and a number of guests enjoyed several tales from the keen recollection of Owen Hughs. 

Mr Hughes, 100, is one of the last remaining WWII artists who painted the noses of fighter planes, jackets, and anything else he could get his brushes on. 

His tales are sprinkled with humor. He has an email list to distribute his stories. Join at ohughes1@gmail.com
