## Welcome to the Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild

The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild is a learning guild with members at all levels of experience. By sharing a love of traditional and contemporary handwritten letters, we build friendships and a greater confidence in our art.

**Our Meetings are held at the Perinton Community Center at 1350Turk Hill Road, most months in room 205.**

**Speedball Textbook**

The “Centennial Edition” of the Speedball Textbook features an expanded history section showcasing additional pages from older editions as well as all new artwork in the “Gallery” and “Logo & Design” sections, and much more!

In conjunction with the new book, they have a website (http://www.speedballart.com) which has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) about their products, and some downloads under the Media tab for screen printing, lettering, drawing.

The Speedball Textbook book has always been a reflection of the lettering of its time. This special Centennial Edition is a record of lettering today and an invaluable resource for students of all ages and levels.
