## Welcome to the Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild

 

The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild is a learning guild with members at all levels of experience. By sharing a love of traditional and contemporary handwritten letters, we build friendships and a greater confidence in our art.

 

Our regular meetings are held the First Wednesday of the month at 7 PM at the Barnes and Noble in Pittsford, NY. Our meeting room is large, open, and has tables on which to work.

 

One-day or weekend workshops are held two or more times a year. Recent instructors have included Randall Hasson, Annie Barnhardt (Gail Vick Barnhardt), Carol Henshaw, Sandra Collins, Carrie Imai, Rosie Kelly, Sherri Kiesel, Sherrie Lovler, Ruth Vaughan, Roann Mathias.

Speedball Textbook

The “Centennial Edition” of the Speedball Textbook features an expanded history section showcasing additional pages from older editions as well as all new artwork in the “Gallery” and “Logo & Design” sections, and much more!

In conjunction with the new book, they are planning a website (http://www.speedballart.com) which will have instructional videos and copies of many of the older editions. It currently has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) about their products, and some downloads under the Media tab for screen printing, lettering, drawing.

The Speedball Textbook book has always been a reflection of the lettering of its time. This special Centennial Edition is a record of lettering today and an invaluable resource for students of all ages and levels.
