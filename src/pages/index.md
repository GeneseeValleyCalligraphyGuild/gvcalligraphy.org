**Speedball Textbook**

The “Centennial Edition” of the Speedball Textbook features an expanded history section showcasing additional pages from older editions as well as all new artwork in the “Gallery” and “Logo & Design” sections, and much more!

In conjunction with the new book, they have a website (http://www.speedballart.com) which has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) about their products, and some downloads under the Media tab for screen printing, lettering, drawing.

The Speedball Textbook book has always been a reflection of the lettering of its time. This special Centennial Edition is a record of lettering today and an invaluable resource for students of all ages and levels.
