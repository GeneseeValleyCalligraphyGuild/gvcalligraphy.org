## Welcome to the Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild

![Artist: Annie Barnhardt](/img/annieb_forever.jpg)

The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild is a learning guild with members at all levels of experience. By sharing a love of traditional and contemporary handwritten letters, we build friendships and a greater confidence in our art.

The guild was founded in April, 1983 in Rochester, NY. We practice beautiful hand lettering; some of our members have been with us from our founding, others are very new to calligraphy. We all love letters and lettering.

**We are meeting again in the Perinton Community Center; pre-registration is required for in-person attendance. If you're interested in attending a meeting please send an email to thgvcalligraphy@gmail.com at least 2 weeks before the meeting.**

**Our Meetings are held at the Perinton Community Center at 1350Turk Hill Road, most months in room 204A.**

One-day or weekend workshops are held two or more times a year. Recent instructors have included Barbara Close, Randall Hasson, Annie Barnhardt (Gail Vick Barnhardt), Carol Henshaw, Carrie Imai, Rosie Kelly, Lorrie Frear.

In-person workshops are on hold for the time being; see [John Neal's Website](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/instructor-book-supply-lists) for a list of online classes.

**Speedball Textbook**

The “Centennial Edition” of the Speedball Textbook features an expanded history section showcasing additional pages from older editions as well as all new artwork!

In conjunction with the book, they have a website (http://www.speedballart.com) which has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) about their products, and some downloads under the Media tab for screen printing, lettering, drawing.

The Speedball Textbook book has always been a reflection of the lettering of its time. This special Centennial Edition is a record of lettering today and an invaluable resource for students of all ages and levels.
