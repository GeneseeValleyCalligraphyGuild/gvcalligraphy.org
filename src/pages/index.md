## Welcome to the Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild

![Artist: Annie Barnhardt](/img/annieb_forever.jpg)

The Genesee Valley Calligraphy Guild is a learning guild with members at all levels of experience. By sharing a love of traditional and contemporary handwritten letters, we build friendships and a greater confidence in our art.

The guild was founded in April, 1983 in Rochester, NY. We practice beautiful hand lettering; some of our members have been with us from our founding, others are very new to calligraphy. We all love letters and lettering.

**Beginning February 1, 2023 we will be meeting in the Community Room at the Barnes and Noble store in Pittsford Plaza. We plan to make these meetings hybrid to enable those who cannot be there in person to participate.**

We meet on the First Wednesday of each month at 7:00 PM,. We welcome prospective new members to attend a meeting before joining. The programs are varied and cover topics of interest to the lettering artist.

On January 14, we will have Play Day from 11 AM - 1 PM at the Perinton Community Center at 1350 Turk Hill Road.

**This year is our 40th Anniversary and we are planning many activities to celebrate.**

In-person workshops are on hold for the time being; see [John Neal's Website](https://www.johnnealbooks.com/prod_detail_list/instructor-book-supply-lists) for a list of online classes.

We are a sponsor for the 2021 Legacies Conference - we sent them nearly 400 Crane artist trading cards to put in the grab bags!

**Speedball Textbook**

The “Centennial Edition” of the Speedball Textbook features an expanded history section showcasing additional pages from older editions as well as all new artwork!

In conjunction with the book, they have a website (http://www.speedballart.com) which has Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) about their products, and some downloads under the Media tab for screen printing, lettering, drawing.

The Speedball Textbook book has always been a reflection of the lettering of its time. This special Centennial Edition is a record of lettering today and an invaluable resource for students of all ages and levels.
